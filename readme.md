✅ Features
----------

-   🔍 **Messy Time Recognition**\
    Advanced regex detects time mentions like `10 00AM`, `7pm`, `5:30 am`, `8: 00PM`, etc.

-   🌍 **Timezone Auto-Conversion**\
    Replies to each user **ephemerally** with the time converted to **their Slack-set timezone**, including **Daylight Saving Time** adjustments.

-   🔒 **Private and Clutter-Free**\
    Uses ephemeral messages --- no message flooding, only the intended user sees the converted time.

⚠️ Known Limitations
--------------------

-   ❌ **Ambiguous Timezones Not Handled**\
    Timezones like `ET` or `NZST` are skipped due to conflicts (e.g., `ET` = Eastern Time *or* Egyptian Time).

-   🤖 **No Conversion for Bots**\
    Bots don't have timezones set via the Slack API, so no conversions are sent to them.

🚀 Use Case
-----------

> *"Meeting at 9:30am tomorrow PST"*\
> Every human user will get a private message showing the converted time in their own timezone, taking DST into account.

📦 How It Works
---------------

1.  Listens to messages in real-time using Slack's Socket Mode.

2.  Parses timestamps using smart regex.

3.  For each human user in the thread or channel:

    -   Fetches their timezone via Slack API.

    -   Converts time using `zoneinfo` with DST awareness.

    -   Replies with a clean ephemeral message.
